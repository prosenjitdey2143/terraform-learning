# Terraform Learning Journey

Welcome to my repository documenting my journey of learning Terraform, an essential tool for infrastructure as code. This journey captures my daily activities, concepts learned, and hands-on practice as I explore the powerful capabilities of Terraform in cloud infrastructure management.

## Table of Contents
Day 1:  I dived into Terraform for the first time, and it was fascinating! Understanding what Terraform is and why it's used for infrastructure as code has really boosted my enthusiasm to learn more.

Day 2: Used terraform plan to preview the changes. Applied the configuration with terraform apply and successfully created the EC2, Explored the Terraform state file and understood its importance, Cleaned up by destroying the instance with terraform destroy.

Day 3:Understanding Providers (official, partner, and community providers), 
Multi-Region & Multi-Provider Files, Variables in Terraform, File Structure: Explored the file structure for Terraform projects, including the use of terraform.tfvars, and Conditions.

## Next Steps
As I continue this journey, I will explore more advanced concepts so stay tuned for updates.
